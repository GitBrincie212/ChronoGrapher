# ChronoGrapher

> A unified job scheduling and workflow orchestration platform that brings together multiple programming languages (Rust, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Java) under a single, extensible API. Built with Rust for performance and durability, ChronoGrapher provides crash-resistant task scheduling with state persistence.

ChronoGrapher solves the fragmentation problem in modern polyglot applications where each language requires its own scheduling ecosystem. Instead of managing multiple schedulers (Airflow for Python, BullMQ for Node.js, etc.), ChronoGrapher provides one unified solution that scales from single machines to distributed clusters.

Key features:
- **Multi-language SDKs** with consistent APIs across Rust, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Java
- **Extensible architecture** with pluggable components for task frames, schedulers, and persistence backends
- **Crash-resistant durability** through state persistence and recovery mechanisms
- **Flexible scheduling** supporting intervals, cron expressions, calendar-based schedules, and immediate execution
- **Composable task frames** for building complex workflows with retry logic, timeouts, fallbacks, and more
- **Dependency management** for orchestrating tasks based on completion states of other tasks
