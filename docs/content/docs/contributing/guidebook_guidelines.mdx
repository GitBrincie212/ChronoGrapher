This page mentions how to write effective guidebook documentation for the ChronoGrapher project,
this domain knowledge applies to the core, every SDK, every extension / integration... etc.

Guidebook documentation should be the final part, once the feature stabilizes, documenting too early will lead
to technical debt. As such ensure you will rarely make significant changes later down the line.

It should be mentioned, contributors are expected to have experience reading guidebook documentation from other projects and
from ChronoGrapher while also partially writing their own.

The page doesn't go in-depth on how to describe things clearly as it is something gained through experience, it is advised
to look at ChronoGrapher's guidebook docs and learn from there.

In summary ChronoGrapher's language is meant to be overly strict and explicit, it strives for simplicity while
emphasizing narration and progressiveness, as the guidebook is the first source beginner devs preview.

# Goals Of Guidebook Documentation
When writing Guidebook documentation for ChronoGrapher, regardless of environment, the main goals stay consistent and
specifically are:
- **Progressive Learning:** The guidebook is meant to introduce features gradually, from simple to complex ones. Even
  when simple and complex features are interconnected, the guidebook focuses on the main feature (though it leave
  some explanation for the complex one if necessary).
- **Patterns, Concepts and Thinking Model:** Whereas API documentation is concerned with syntax. The guidebook teaches concepts, patterns
  and thinking models regardless the programming language (though still depending on the user's programming language, there
  are examples to follow).
- **Focused Learning** The guidebook is built for developers to learn effectively concepts. As such it uses visual components,
  breaks components to small chapters (around 1k words) and explains why and how things work the way they do, as well as when
  to actually use them.

# What The Guidebook Isn't For
Guidebook documentation is its own category of documentation. It achieves these above goals very well and does not strive to
excel in more requirements than it needs to (other parts carry such as API documentation):
- **Component-specific Niches** The guidebook doesn't concern itself with introducing every minute detail about the component
  it describes. Instead, it gradually introduces it, anything too niche, too advanced or otherwise unnecessary isn't present
  in the guidebook, this is the job of API documentation.
- **How To X** While the guidebook has examples and uses commonly with one or multiple components for any common problem,
  if there is a problem that is too specific. The guidebook simply won't cover it as to not increase cognitive load for
  no apparent reason.

# Visual Components
While powerful as pictures describe a thousand words and preferable in some cases due to their reduced cognitive load,
they should be used sparingly as too much noise may distract.

## Media
Media is not as common of a sight in the documentation, except for **Diagrams** which are meant to show interaction
between multiple components or represent visually the placement of these components.

Examples include but are not limited to:
<ThemeBasedImage
    light={"/diagram-light-1.svg"} dark={"/diagram-dark-1.svg"}
    width={1200} height={1200}
    alt={"Spectrum Diagram From Left (most simple / minimal) To Right (most complex / enterprise)"}
/>
<ThemeBasedImage
    light={"/diagram-light-2.svg"} dark={"/diagram-dark-2.svg"}
    width={1200} height={1200}
    alt={"Diagram of Task's layout and communication between the Scheduler"}
/>
Diagrams should be ``1200x1200`` pixels in resolution, the guidebook uses [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) to draw
these diagrams, any type of media (either animation or diagrams) should have a light/dark mode version of itself.
