This page mentions how to write effective guidebook documentation for the ChronoGrapher project,
this domain knowledge applies to the core, every SDK, every extension / integration... etc.

Guidebook documentation should be the final part, once the feature stabilizes, documenting too early will lead
to technical debt. As such ensure you will rarely make significant changes later down the line.

It should be mentioned, contributors are expected to have experience reading guidebook documentation from other projects and
from ChronoGrapher while also partially writing their own.

The page doesn't go in-depth on how to describe things clearly as it is something gained through experience, it is advised
to look at ChronoGrapher's guidebook docs and learn from there.

However, in summary ChronoGrapher's language is meant to be overly strict and explicit, while it strives for
simplicity, it knows guidebooks are the first source beginner devs preview and emphasizes narration and progressiveness.
