title: "AI Use Guidelines"
description: "Discusses when its allowed and how to use AI in ChronoGrapher"
---

AI is one of the more prevalent and controversial topics in recent times, but a critical thing to mention in the contribution
guidelines, as software development more and more relies on AI in some areas.

ChronoGrapher's team is partially mixed with AI, while it is an invaluable tool in some specific niches, it is overrated
in areas where it was advertised. We encourage human-crafted content over AI-based content.

In this guideline spec, we will mention why and how improper use of AI harms the project, the niches where AI should be used
correctly and best practices.

# About Vibe Coding / AI-Assisted Coding
One of the first use cases which ChronoGrapher's team <Highlight color={"error"}>STRICTLY DISCOURAGES</Highlight> is **Vibe Coding**, it is defined as:
> an AI-assisted software development method where developers describe desired functionality
in natural language prompts, and a Large Language Model (LLM) generates the code.

The main idea is coding is fully delegated to AI, and the software engineer writes in natural language (via prompts) what
the code wants to do.

This can be achieved with "simple" general-purpose tools such as [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com),
[Claude](https://claude.ai/)... etc. Or with more specialized IDEs and AI systems such as [Cursor](https://cursor.com),
[Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and so on and so forth.

The reason for why it is heavily discouraged is it promotes <u>**Poorly-Written Code**, **Inconsistent Code Styles** and
**Mindless Prompting Till It Works**</u>.

These disadvantages are what waste both the contributor's time (they're just a puppet really controlling a guessing system)
and the team's time (as they would need to check the code rigorously).

Besides this time loss, its proven time and time again that Vibe Coding is not a sustainable practice and requires heavy
rewriting when faced with scalability issues.

Examples include [Microsoft Reporting ~30% Of Its Code is AI-Generated](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/satya-nadella-says-as-much-as-30percent-of-microsoft-code-is-written-by-ai.html).
While large companies can afford massive QA pipelines, AI-assisted development has also contributed to an increase in rushed and fragile products,
including security incidents such as [The Tea App Breach](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce87rer52k3o), and many others.

To top it all off, most of <u>the project relies on skills such as **System-Design**, **Architectural Thinking**,
**Tradeoff Awareness** and **Deep Problem-Solving**</u>.

With all major negativity aside, the only niches where AI-Assisted Coding is useful (not fully Vibe Coding) are:
- Writing partially unit-tests (though humans should be involved as well).
- Simple to medium debugging purposes (often fails and thus needs human ingenuity again).
- Rarely boilerplate-writing (usually however, you would make it more ergonomic via macros and such).
- Emulation of a system without the code (how would the users interact with the system).

So in summary, most of the time, the human should be in-charge of writing the code. Only partially the AI may assist
the human for the above use cases, proper use increases productivity and vice versa.

# About AI-Written PRs, Commit Messages
ChronoGrapher's team is <Highlight color={"error"}>OPPOSED</Highlight> to AI-written **Pull Requests** and **Commit Messages**,
as they clearly signal low-quality and quick-and-dirty style work.

Contributors must document thoroughly what they have done, what they have added, what they have fixed and everything
in-between, letting LLMs write the description is clearly laziness.

Though it can be used for assisting in what to write but most of the content written in the PR should be written by
a human and not a machine.

# About AI-Assisted Documentation
While documentation is a boring topic to some, it is equally important as the system's code. Poor documentation leads
to frustration, unconsidered gotchas... etc.

To alleviate this, usually documentation is assisted by AI (or fully made), depending on the circumstance it may be
encouraged or discouraged but generally ChronoGrapher's team is <Highlight color={"warn"}>MIXED</Highlight>.

On one hand, fully letting the LLM document your system is a recipe for disaster as it omits information, doesn't follow
the documentation guidelines... etc. This is the same as vibe coding but for technical writing.

On the other, one can leverage the LLM's abilities of professional technical writing, point of view of documentation and
greater knowledge of multiple sources of documentation.

Just like above, these newfound powers should be controlled, as such LLMs must act as assistants and the documentation
should be crafted by the contributor themselves, even if it is boring.

Which is where the **Document-Critic Flow** can help, whereby the contributor writes the documentation themselves while following
the guidelines and the AI assists in the documentation by criticizing areas.

These can be grammar mistakes, structural issues... etc. Instead of the contributor, however, blindly copy-pasting
documentation (very similar to Vibe Coding), they critique and tweak the documentation.

Though, not all feedback should be trusted by AI, depending on what and how you wrote the documentation, you may need
to clarify something's done on purpose, for example the fact docs are still WIP.

While this loop can help, the key is control, the contributor must pilot the writing and do 70% of the work, whereas
the AI handles pointing some polishing, structural and grammatical issues.

The documentation guidelines depend on what content you are writing, for example [API Documentation Guidelines](./api_docs_guidelines)
has different rules versus [Guidebook Documentation Guidelines](./guidebook_guidelines).

# About AI-Assisted Architectural Thinking
Instead of fully dedicating the LLM into thinking more in-depth about the code and the design space,
the LLM assists in the decision-making process by offering its own "perspective".

Questions may range from "how to maximize ergonomics for X", "why does Y fail at scale and how to fix"... etc.
While LLMs tend to provide the complete code, it shouldn't be directly copy-pasted (as its Vibe Coding).

The idea is gaining another perspective of the problem, think of it like an assistant offering their own solution on
things, while sometimes itself isn't useful, it often leads to an approach unconsidered.

The contributor shouldn't follow blindly the solution given to them (again this is Vibe Coding), in fact, they should
constructively criticize and outline why they <Highlight color={"success"}>SHOULD</Highlight> and
<Highlight color={"error"}>SHOULDN'T</Highlight> follow this approach.

By following this principle, while considering the tradeoffs, they <u>may</u> naturally land on a good design by considering
other perspectives that tackle this problem.

By no means it works all the time, as the LLMs often fail providing a good solution, <u>they are only meant to nudge in the
right direction, not be the pilot</u>.

Once the contributor has landed on a good solution, they should start implementing mostly by themselves, whilst implementing
rarely they should be assisted by LLMs.

In addition to suggesting solutions, it can be partially used for criticism in how well the architecture is defined,
without following blindly its feedback without critical logical assessment done by the contributor.

The ChronoGrapher team <Highlight color={"success"}>ENCOURAGES</Highlight> this practice. As it promotes actual **Critical
Thinking** and **Creativity** instead of blindly copy-pasting, however it is not without its downsides.

For one, this requires time, and as mentioned it is non-guaranteed (very common) the AI's perspective may work, the creative
part comes now from this nudging in the right direction, by mixing or by thinking differently.

# Disclose AI Use-Cases
When opening a PR, the individual should disclose exactly where AI has been used, not following this principle at best
the maintainer (McBrincie212) will close your PR, at worst they may fully backlist any PRs from you.

The description of AI usage should be in bullet list and reasonably detailed, and not a simple "I used AI in X" but rather explain
where it helped specifically and by how much you've altered its output.

It is a recommended practice (though can be omitted if a minor thing) for contributors to mention which decisions have
been influenced by AI.

It should be mentioned that if the code is majorly refactored by the contributor (at least around ~60-80%), it doesn't count as
fully AI-generated content and hence can be omitted in the description.

If the PR has most of its content (around ~40%) written by AI, it may be fully terminated and even lead to a shadow-ban
if repeated throughout.

Keep in mind also the above principles, here is a bullet list of what is allowed, what is allowed with caution and what isn't
allowed:
- [ ✅ ] Using AI as an assistant in documentation (~70% have to be human-written or heavily refactored).
- [ ✅ ] Using AI for assisting architectural thinking (never relying on it to fully tell the solution).
- [ ⚠️ ] Using AI for assisting criticism (never blindly following its instructions).
- [ ⚠️ ] Using AI for writing code (depends on what kind of code and how critical).
- [ 🚫 ] Letting AI write most of the documentation (even for a small feature).
- [ 🚫 ] Vibe coding features (even if small ones).

When in doubt, ask the maintainer (McBrincie212) before you submit.
