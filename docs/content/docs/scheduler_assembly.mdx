# Assembling Our Own Scheduler

With that, we can begin to make our custom ``Scheduler`` by combining these separate composites. To begin we create
a new file called <RenderProgrammingLanguageBased target_name={"Rust"}>``my_custom_scheduler.rs``</RenderProgrammingLanguageBased>,
then write code:
<RenderProgrammingLanguageBased target_name={"Rust"}>
    ```rust title="src/main.rs" lineNumbers
    use chronographer::prelude::*;

    #[scheduler(
    clock:
    store:
    dispatcher:
    engine:
    )]
    struct MyCustomScheduler<C: SchedulerConfig>
    ```
</RenderProgrammingLanguageBased>
