The core package of Chronolog provides the fundamental building blocks of the project. It defines the essential logic and data structures that power Chronolog, forming the foundation on which all other components are built. This package is designed for two primary purposes:

- **Rust crate usage** – offering a clean and efficient API for Rust developers.
- **Language bindings** – serving as the underlying implementation that can be wrapped and exposed to other programming languages, ensuring consistency and performance across ecosystems.

By keeping the core functionality centralized here, Chronolog maintains reliability, portability, and a single source of truth for its essential features.
