/// When construing a [`DependencyTaskFrame`] the only way to do so is via

///
/// # Behavior
/// - Before executing the [`TaskFrame`] it calls [`FrameDependency::is_resolved`] on all

/// - if they are then the [`TaskFrame`] executes, otherwise [`DependentFailBehavior`] takes over
///
/// # Events
/// When it comes to events, [`DependencyTaskFrame`], there is only one, that being
/// [`ConditionalFrame::on_dependency`] which is triggered for every dependency and
/// hosts the [`FrameDependency`] as well as if it has been resolved (as boolean)
///

/// is a part of the default provided implementations, however there are many others
///

/// ```ignore
