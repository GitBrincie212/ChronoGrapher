/// [`Task`] represents a unit of work that can be scheduled and executed by a [`Scheduler`].
///
/// Each task encapsulates the following:
/// - its execution logic via `execute_inner(&self)`,
/// - metadata such as run counts and last execution time,
/// - scheduling information via `Schedule`,
/// - and concurrency/overlap behavior via `OverlapStrategy`.
///
/// # Execution
///
/// Tasks are executed via the [`process`] method, which combines the taskâ€™s `execute_inner`
/// logic with a [`CancellationToken`] to allow preemptive cancellation. This ensures tasks
/// can safely run in parallel or be aborted by the scheduler or overlap policies.
///
/// # Methods
///
/// - [`Task::execute_inner`] The core async logic of the task. Returns `Ok(())` on success,
/// or an `Arc<dyn Error>` on failure. This method acts as an internal one
/// - [`Task::process`] Executes the task while observing the provided `CancellationToken`. Returns an error
///  if execution was aborted. This method is the main entrypoint for execution and **SHOULD NOT** be overridden
/// - [`Task::get_schedule`] Returns the schedule that controls when this task should be executed.
/// - [`Task::total_runs`] / [`Task::set_total_runs`] Get or update the total number of times the task has executed.
/// - [`Task::maximum_runs`] / [`Task::set_maximum_runs`]  Get or set the maximum number of times
/// the task is allowed to run. Returns `None` if the maximum tasks allowed are unlimited
/// - [`Task::remaining_runs`] Calculates how many runs remain before reaching `maximum_runs`. Returns `None` if
/// unlimited. This method is mostly a helper one and **SHOULD NOT** be overridden
/// - [`Task::set_last_execution`] / [`Task::last_execution`] Get or update the timestamp of the last execution.
/// - [`Task::get_debug_label`] Returns a human-readable label useful for logging or debugging.
/// - [`Task::overlap_policy`] Returns the [`OverlapStrategy`] that defines how this task behaves when
/// overlapping executions occur (e.g., sequential, parallel, replace previous/current).
///
/// # Notes
/// - All methods are async to allow concurrent-safe access to internal state and metadata.
///
/// - The scheduler is responsible for mutating metadata (runs, last execution) and for
///   triggering task execution according to the schedule.
///
/// - Tasks should not modify their own scheduling or run-count metadata outside the
///   scheduler context.
