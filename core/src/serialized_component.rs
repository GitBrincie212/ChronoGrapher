/// [`SerializedComponent`] is a container that wraps a **unique** identifier (ID) corresponding
/// to a concrete type and an IR (Intermediate Representation) as JSON that is not type-safe but
/// represents an object in a [`PersistenceBackend`] agnostic way
///
/// # Constructor(s)
/// When constructing [`SerializedComponent`], the straightforward and commonly used approach is
/// to use [`SerializedComponent::new`] where one can supply their type and the JSON representation
/// of the object they serialized, alternatively they can also use [`SerializedComponent::new_with`],
/// however the user has to supply their own ID **which have to be certain that it is unique for this
/// type**
///
/// # Trait Implementation(s)
/// [`SerializedComponent`] only implements the [`Clone`] trait
///
/// # Cloning Semantics
/// [`SerializedComponent`] deeply clones the intermediate representation as well as the ID
///
/// # See Also
/// - [`PersistenceBackend`]
/// - [`SerializedComponent::new`]
/// - [`SerializedComponent::new_with`]
